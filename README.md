## Project Requirements

* Frontend of a small dynamic news website.
* Components/Modules/Page:
    * News Overview
    * News Details page
        * dynamic component of your frontend
* Design / Layout
    * Should be responsive (adapt to desktop or mobile screen sizes respectively)
    * Effects or transitions during user interaction 
* Navigation:
    * [Dummy menu] Navigation bar with two levels (The second level is only shown if a user clicks on the first level)

## Things that can be improved

I didnâ€™t want to spend more time than the specified, but I feel we can improve a bit on the following things:

* Use React Helmet or custom service to have dynamic Opengraphs meta tags. It will help us to have better SEO for every page we have in our app.
* To have a better UX, I am currently fetching the same news API and filtering the content on the page. In the real world, we would have a separate API for news details which we can integrate with minor adaptations in the useNewsDetail hook.
